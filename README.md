# Project Title: Adult Census Income Dataset

## Overview:
    This project uses adult census dataset (classification dataset) to predict the income of the customers based on features like age, workclass, fnlwght(final weight), education.num, accupation and sex.

## Features:
    - Comparison between estimators Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost
    - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
    - Evaluation metrics like precision, recall, accuracy, classification report for each model

## Technologies:
    - Python 3.9
    - VsCode
    - Pandas 
    - Numpy
    - XGBoost
    - Scikit-Learn
    - Seaborn
